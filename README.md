# FusionNet
FusionNet is a network for to estimate high-frame rate heart model from corresponding low-frame rate heart model.

## Environment setup
```
chmod +x setup_cuda.sh.sh
./script-name.sh
```

## Dataset 
- Dataset folder name: data 
- Input data: low-frame rate heart model (size: 80×80×80×5) consisting of 5 voxel models in 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 frames.
- Output data: high-frame rate heart model (size: 80×80×80×10) consisting of 10 voxel models in 1-10 frames.
- Each heart model is a set of voxel models generated by extracting left venticle regions from Cine images published in UK Biobank (application no. 20209).
- Each voxel model represents the 3D shape of the left venticle in a frame.

3. For fusion network experiment and ablation studies
- Training
```
python LoopFusion.py (FusionNetwork)
```                                                   
- Testing
```
python test.py
```
- Evaluation (the evaluation of the frame accuracy)
```
python frame comparison.py
```
